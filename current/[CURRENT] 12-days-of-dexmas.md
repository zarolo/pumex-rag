**12 DAYS OF DEXMAS — PUMEX**

**OVERVIEW**

This document defines the current “12 Days of DEXmas” campaign for Pumex.

It is a simple, social-only Christmas campaign designed to maintain visibility, grow engagement, and deepen the Samurai narrative during the holiday period.

**PROJECT DETAILS**

Project: Pumex

Theme: Samurai × Christmas / Winter

Format: 12-day social raffle campaign

Primary channel: X

Total budget: 1,000 USD prize pool

**CORE GOAL**

Grow @PumexFi followers and engagement on X while the market is quieter over the holidays, and build a core group of active “Samurai” participants that can be re-engaged for future launches.

**SECONDARY GOALS**

Increase replies and quote tweets (not just likes)

Strengthen narrative continuity around Samurai behaviour

Identify highly engaged users for future community initiatives

**HIGH-LEVEL CONCEPT**

The campaign runs for 12 consecutive days leading up to and including Christmas Day.

Each day includes:

* One main DEXmas post on X

* A Samurai / Christmas themed daily name

* One simple social action

* A small prize pool for that day

Rewards increase progressively:

* Smaller rewards at the start

* Larger rewards mid-campaign

* A spike on Christmas Eve

* The largest rewards on Christmas Day

**CAMPAIGN DURATION**

Duration: 12 consecutive days

Includes: Christmas Eve and Christmas Day

**DAILY FLOW**

Each day, the following flow applies:

1. Pumex posts the daily DEXmas tweet.

2. Users must:

   * Follow @PumexFi

   * Like the post

   * Repost the post

   * Complete the daily task (reply or quote tweet, as specified)

   * Have already completed the one-time registration form

3. At the end of the day:

   * Replies and quote tweets are exported

   * Entries are checked against the registration list

   * Eligible winners are selected for that day’s prize pool

**REGISTRATION FORM (ONE-TIME)**

To be eligible for any prizes, users must complete a one-time registration form.

Required fields:

* X handle

* Wallet address

* Telegram handle (optional)

Notes:

* The form is filled once only

* Only registered users are eligible to win prizes

* Registration data is used solely for prize distribution and contact purposes

**STREAK AND GRAND PRIZES**

The campaign includes a streak mechanic to reward consistent participation.

* Users who participate every day build a “streak”

* Streak users receive special eligibility on:

  * Day 11 (Christmas Eve): special “Eve chest” for streak users

  * Day 12 (Christmas Day): largest “Grand Samurai” chest for full streak users

Important:

* Casual users are not locked out

* Christmas Eve and Christmas Day still include smaller prizes for any registered daily participants

* Streak only affects eligibility for the top-tier chests

**REWARDS STRUCTURE (HIGH LEVEL)**

Total prize pool: 1,000 USD

* Days 1–10:

  * Smaller daily prize pools

  * Gradually increasing toward Christmas

* Day 11 (Christmas Eve):

  * Medium-sized prize pool

  * Includes a streak-only main prize

* Day 12 (Christmas Day):

  * 500 USD total

  * Largest “Grand Samurai” chest for streak users

  * Additional smaller side prizes for other participants

Exact per-day prize allocations are predefined internally to ensure the total remains exactly 1,000 USD.

**WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE**

* Keep Pumex visible and active on X during the holiday period

* Encourage thoughtful replies and quote tweets, not passive engagement

* Identify a small group of “Core Samurai” who consistently show up

* Maintain simple mechanics:

  * No on-chain actions

  * No complex quests or XP systems

  * X interactions plus a single registration form only

**BOUNDARIES AND NOTES**

* This campaign does not involve protocol usage, trading, or liquidity actions

* Participation does not affect on-chain rewards or governance

* Campaign mechanics are independent of protocol mechanics and tokenomics

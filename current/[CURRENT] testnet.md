### **Summary**

* Pumex maintains a testnet deployment for experimentation, onboarding, and QA.

* Testnet is designed for learning core mechanics without risking real capital.

* Test tokens have no real-world value.

* Features and parameters on testnet may differ from mainnet.

---

### **Overview**

Pumex is available on InjectiveEVM testnet as a sandbox environment where users can explore protocol mechanics and product flows in a low-stakes setting.

Testnet is useful for:

* first-time users learning how swaps, liquidity, gauges, and voting work,

* builders and partners validating integrations,

* the community reporting UX issues or bugs,

* and experimenting with strategies using test tokens.

---

### **What You Can Do on Testnet**

#### **Swaps**

* Test swapping flows across available pool types.

* Explore classic and concentrated liquidity swap paths where enabled.

#### **Liquidity Provision**

* Provide liquidity using manual positions or supported automated strategies (ALMs).

* Understand how range-based liquidity behaves under price movement.

#### **Staking**

* Stake eligible liquidity positions into gauges (where enabled).

* Learn how gauge participation works in practice.

#### **Voting**

* Vote in gauges using test vePMX (where enabled).

* Practice how emissions direction works across epochs.

#### **Delegation (Optional)**

* Test delegated voting and “set-and-manage” governance participation (where supported).

#### **Feedback Loop**

* Report issues, share UX feedback, and suggest improvements based on testnet usage.

---

### **Feedback and Bug Reporting**

If you encounter issues or have suggestions:

* share feedback via Discord, and/or

* submit through the testnet feedback form (if provided).

Include:

* the page or flow where the issue occurred,

* expected vs actual behavior,

* and screenshots or transaction links if available.

---

### **Reminder: Test Tokens**

PMX and other testnet tokens:

* have **no real value**,

* are for experimentation only,

* and do not represent mainnet balances.

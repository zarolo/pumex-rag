### **Summary**

* Options Liquidity Mining (OLM) is Pumex’s emissions framework for rewarding liquidity providers.

* Emissions are issued as **oPMX**, an option-style reward token.

* oPMX introduces flexible redemption paths that align incentives without forcing immediate dilution.

* The model encourages long-term participation and governance alignment.

---

### **Overview**

Options Liquidity Mining is Pumex’s approach to distributing liquidity incentives in a **capital-efficient and sustainable** way.

Instead of emitting PMX directly, Pumex rewards eligible liquidity providers with **oPMX**.

oPMX represents a claim with configurable redemption paths, allowing participants to choose how — and when — to realize value.

This structure:

* gives LPs strategic flexibility,

* aligns incentives with long-term participation,

* and protects the protocol from misaligned, short-term emissions.

---

### **What Is oPMX?**

oPMX is Pumex’s emissions instrument.

It is earned by liquidity providers who:

* stake eligible liquidity positions into gauges, and

* receive vePMX voting support during an emission epoch.

oPMX is not a direct PMX transfer.

Instead, it grants holders **optional paths** to convert rewards into governance power or PMX exposure under defined conditions.

### **oPMX Redemption Options**

Liquidity providers who earn oPMX may choose from the following redemption paths, subject to protocol parameters.

---

### **1\. Redeem for PMX at a Discount**

oPMX can be exchanged for PMX at a discounted rate.

Key characteristics:

* The discount rate is set by protocol parameters.

* The holder pays a portion of the PMX notional value to redeem.

* This mechanism introduces price sensitivity and discourages immediate sell pressure.

Example (illustrative only):

Redeem 100 oPMX for 100 PMX at a 60% discount, paying the equivalent of 40 units of value.

This option provides flexibility while preserving protocol sustainability.

---

### **2\. Convert to vePMX**

oPMX can be converted into **vote-locked PMX (vePMX)**.

This path:

* increases long-term governance participation,

* aligns LPs with protocol decision-making,

* and enables access to trading fees, incentives, and voting influence.

Example (illustrative only):

Convert 100 oPMX into 100 vePMX at a 1:1 ratio, subject to lock conditions.

This option favors participants who want deeper alignment with the ecosystem.

---

### **Utilization of Redemption Value**

Value generated through oPMX redemptions is redistributed to support the protocol.

Depending on governance configuration, this value may:

* be distributed to vePMX voters as vote yield,

* be used for PMX buybacks,

* or be allocated to protocol reserves.

This flexible allocation allows the system to adapt across different market conditions.

---

### **Why Options Liquidity Mining Matters**

#### **Reduced Emissions Pressure**

Emissions are gated behind redemption decisions rather than released directly into the market.

---

#### **Stronger Alignment**

Participants who remain engaged longer receive greater influence and utility.

---

#### **Sustainable Incentives**

Rewards are tied to governance, usage, and optionality — not unconditional inflation.

---

### **How Options Liquidity Mining Fits the System**

Options Liquidity Mining connects directly to:

* **Liquidity Provision** (who earns oPMX),

* **Gauges** (how emissions are allocated),

* **vePMX Governance** (who controls incentives),

* and the **Incentive Engine** (how value circulates).

Together, these components form a loop where:

* productive liquidity is rewarded,

* governance directs incentives,

* and emissions compound alignment over time.

### **Important Notes**

* Redemption rates, discounts, and allocation parameters are governed and may change via approved processes.

* Examples shown are illustrative and not guarantees.

* oPMX is designed to reward participation, not to promise returns.

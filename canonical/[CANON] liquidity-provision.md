### **Summary**

* Pumex offers multiple liquidity provision models to match different risk and management preferences.

* Users can choose between classic full-range liquidity and concentrated liquidity.

* Concentrated liquidity can be managed manually or via ALM strategies.

* Emissions require gauge staking; trading fees flow to vePMX voters.

---

### **Overview**

Pumex provides flexible liquidity provision options designed to support both:

* simple, hands-off participation, and

* advanced, capital-efficient strategies.

Whether a user prefers full control or automated optimization, Pumex allows liquidity to be deployed in a way that aligns with individual risk tolerance and effort.

---

### **Classic (Full-Range Liquidity)**

**Simple, familiar AMM exposure**

Classic liquidity provision spreads capital across the entire price curve.

This model:

* requires no range management,

* supports both volatile and stable pairs,

* and mirrors traditional AMM behavior.

It is ideal for users seeking straightforward exposure without active position management, trading capital efficiency for simplicity.

---

### **Concentrated Liquidity**

**Capital-efficient liquidity within defined price ranges**

Concentrated liquidity allows users to deploy capital within a custom price range.

When the market trades within that range:

* liquidity is used more efficiently,

* effective depth increases,

* and fee generation per unit of capital improves.

This model requires more active management or automation.

---

### **Ways to Provide Concentrated Liquidity**

#### **Manual**

* Users define their own price range.

* Positions must be monitored and adjusted as price moves.

* Offers maximum control and customization.

---

#### **Automated (ALM-Managed)**

* Users select from ALM-managed strategies.

* The ALM dynamically adjusts ranges and rebalances positions.

* Designed for users who want capital efficiency without micromanagement.

Manual and automated approaches coexist, allowing users to choose their preferred level of involvement.

### **Gauge Staking and Rewards**

Liquidity incentives on Pumex are governed through gauges.

To earn **oPMX emissions**, liquidity positions must be:

* deposited into eligible pools, and

* **staked into a gauge** that receives vePMX votes for that epoch.

Key rules:

* **Manual LPs** earn trading fees automatically but must stake to earn emissions.

* **Unstaked positions** do not earn emissions.

* **Only staked positions** are eligible for oPMX rewards.

---

### **Fees vs Emissions (Important Distinction)**

* **Trading fees**

  * Generated by swaps.

  * Distributed **100% to vePMX voters** of the relevant pool.

  * Independent of LP staking.

* **Emissions (oPMX)**

  * Distributed to LPs **only if positions are staked**.

  * Allocation depends on vePMX voting outcomes.

This separation ensures:

* governance participants are rewarded for directing liquidity effectively,

* LP incentives are aligned with active, productive markets.

---

### **Why This Matters**

Liquidity provision on Pumex is not a one-size-fits-all system.

Users can:

* choose simplicity or efficiency,

* opt for control or automation,

* and participate in incentives through governance alignment.

This flexibility allows Pumex to support deep, durable liquidity while avoiding inefficient emissions and idle capital.

### **Summary**

* Pumex is designed to sustain long-term development, governance participation, and ecosystem growth.

* Protocol revenue is managed to support operations, strengthen liquidity health, and reinforce vePMX alignment.

* Revenue sources may include protocol-owned vePMX participation, treasury allocations, and oPMX redemption flows.

* Allocation parameters are governed and may be adjusted via approved processes.

---

### **Overview**

Pumex is built for long-term sustainability. Protocol revenue is structured to support:

* core operations and development,

* governance-driven liquidity depth,

* and incentive alignment across market cycles.

The guiding principle is to maintain a resilient ecosystem where incentives remain meaningful and governance participation is consistently rewarded.

---

### **Treasury Revenue Strategy**

Pumex can maintain a **vePMX position within the DAO treasury**, giving the protocol governance participation across key gauges.

This allows the treasury, where configured and approved, to:

* earn swap-fee revenue and external incentives from voted pools,

* reinforce liquidity depth on strategic markets,

* and strengthen the DAO’s ability to support long-term operations.

This is not intended to replace community governance; it is designed to complement it by ensuring the protocol can remain economically resilient and operationally capable.

---

### **Emissions Allocation**

The protocol may allocate a portion of emissions to the treasury, subject to governance configuration.

Treasury emissions, where enabled, are typically used to fund ecosystem priorities such as:

* protocol-owned or strategic liquidity initiatives,

* technical development and integrations,

* product and UX improvements,

* marketing, community, and ecosystem programs.

Important notes:

* Allocation amounts and rules are governance-defined.

* Usage should follow approved processes and transparency standards.

(If a specific percentage applies in production, document it in a CURRENT/CONFIG section to avoid mixing fixed parameters with canonical concepts.)

### **oPMX Redemption Value Flow**

Value generated from **oPMX redemptions** is allocated with flexibility to maintain sustainability and alignment.

Depending on governance configuration, redemption value may be used for:

* voter yield distributions to vePMX participants (for example via incentives or bribes),

* PMX buybacks,

* treasury reserve growth,

* or other protocol-defined sustainability mechanisms.

This structure is designed to adapt across market conditions while preserving:

* balanced emissions,

* meaningful voter participation incentives,

* and protocol resilience.

---

### **Governance and Change Control**

Revenue flows and allocation parameters are expected to be:

* governed through approved processes,

* change-controlled (e.g., via timelock where applicable),

* and communicated transparently.

This ensures protocol sustainability without introducing opaque, discretionary behavior.

---

### **Key Takeaway**

Protocol revenue is a support layer for Pumex’s long-term health.

By aligning treasury participation, emissions configuration, and redemption value flows with vePMX governance, Pumex reinforces:

* productive liquidity,

* durable incentives,

* and sustainable operations.

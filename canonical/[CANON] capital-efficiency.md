### **Summary**

* Pumex is engineered to maximize capital efficiency across trading, liquidity provision, and incentives.

* Concentrated liquidity allows capital to be deployed where trading actually occurs, rather than spread across unused price ranges.

* Automated Liquidity Managers (ALMs) simplify active management and make capital-efficient strategies accessible to more users.

* The result is deeper liquidity, better execution, and more effective incentives with less wasted capital.

---

### **Overview**

Capital efficiency is a foundational principle of Pumex. The protocol is designed to help users, protocols, and liquidity providers **extract more value from every unit of liquidity**.

Traditional AMMs distribute liquidity evenly across the entire price curve, much of which is rarely used. Pumex instead leverages **concentrated liquidity**, allowing capital to be positioned precisely where trading activity is expected to occur. This results in tighter pricing for traders and higher capital productivity for LPs.

---

### **Why Capital Efficiency Matters**

Most DEXs rely on large amounts of passive liquidity to achieve acceptable price impact. While simple, this approach leads to:

* significant portions of capital sitting idle,

* diluted fee generation,

* and inefficient use of incentive emissions.

By concentrating liquidity around active price ranges:

* **Traders** benefit from better execution and reduced slippage.

* **LPs** earn more per unit of capital deployed.

* **Protocols** can attract deeper, more effective liquidity with fewer emissions.

### **How Capital Efficiency Works on Pumex**

#### **Manual Positions**

Liquidity providers may manually deploy capital within a defined price range (for example, an ETH/USDC range between two chosen prices).

* Liquidity is active only when the market price is within the selected range.

* Fees and incentives accrue while the position remains in-range.

* Positions can be adjusted or redeployed as market conditions change.

This approach offers maximum control, but requires active monitoring.

---

#### **Automated Positions**

For users who prefer a more hands-off approach, Pumex supports **automated liquidity strategies**.

* Ranges are adjusted dynamically based on strategy logic.

* Positions are rebalanced to remain in-range more consistently.

* Capital utilization is optimized without requiring constant manual intervention.

Automated positions are designed to simplify participation while preserving the benefits of concentrated liquidity.

---

### **Key Benefits**

* **Improved Capital Utilization:** Liquidity is deployed where it is most effective, rather than remaining idle.

* **Reduced Slippage:** Deeper liquidity at active price points leads to tighter spreads.

* **Higher Fee Potential:** Concentrated volume increases fee generation for LPs and value flow to vePMX voters.

* **More Efficient Incentives:** Protocols can achieve stronger liquidity outcomes with fewer emissions.

---

### **Tradeoffs and Considerations**

Capital-efficient liquidity introduces new considerations that users should understand:

* **Active Management:** Manual positions require monitoring and adjustment to remain in-range.

* **Price Risk:** Concentrated positions may experience higher exposure if prices move significantly.

* **Complexity:** Range-based mechanics can be challenging for new users.

To address these tradeoffs, Pumex emphasizes automation, guardrails, and education.

### **Simplifying Concentrated Liquidity with ALMs**

To make capital-efficient strategies accessible, Pumex integrates **Automated Liquidity Managers (ALMs)** from selected partners.

ALMs can:

* dynamically adjust ranges based on predefined strategies,

* handle rebalancing and tuning automatically,

* allow users to participate passively while remaining capital-efficient.

Manual liquidity provision remains available for users who want full control. However, **only ALM-managed strategies are eligible for certain incentive mechanisms**, ensuring emissions are directed toward actively managed, effective liquidity.

### **Traditional AMMs vs Concentrated Liquidity**

| Feature | Traditional AMMs | Concentrated Liquidity |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Price Range | Entire curve | Customizable ranges |
| Capital Usage | Largely idle | Precisely deployed |
| Fee Generation | Flat and diluted | Targeted and higher |
| Management | Minimal | Active or automated |

### **Capital Efficiency on Pumex**

By combining concentrated liquidity with ALM automation, Pumex delivers:

* better outcomes for LPs,

* improved execution for traders,

* and a scalable foundation for ve-based incentives and emissions alignment.

As an **ALM-native DEX**, Pumex unlocks the full potential of concentrated liquidity while making it usable by everyone — from new DeFi participants to advanced strategists.

### **Summary**

* Pumex is an Injective-native DEX built around concentrated liquidity, automated strategy vaults (ALMs), and vePMX governance.

* It coordinates liquidity incentives across the ecosystem and routes trades for best execution.

* Designed for traders, LPs, and protocols that want deeper, more efficient, and more sustainable liquidity.

### **What Is Pumex?**

Pumex is an Injective-native decentralized exchange that blends:

* concentrated liquidity,

* automated strategy vaults (ALMs),

* and a vote-escrowed (vePMX) governance system,

to coordinate incentives and liquidity placement across the Injective ecosystem.

Whether you’re a trader seeking low-slippage swaps, a liquidity provider optimizing yield through automated strategies, or a protocol aiming to bootstrap deep, sticky liquidity, Pumex provides the tools to operate in a high-performance, capital-efficient environment.

* ALM-native with plug-and-play strategy vaults

* vePMX-driven emissions coordination and fee governance

* Designed for performance, composability, and long-term liquidity health

### **Mission**

To build the most efficient, strategy-first liquidity layer on Injective, where incentives are aligned and capital works harder for every participant.

### **Who Pumex Is For**

#### **Traders**

* Better execution through routing and deeper liquidity where trading occurs

* Lower slippage on active pairs as liquidity concentrates around price

#### **Liquidity Providers**

* Capital-efficient liquidity provision through concentrated positions

* Optional automation via ALMs to reduce management overhead

* Incentives designed to reward active, effective liquidity

#### **Protocols and Projects**

* A path to bootstrap liquidity in a way that is measurable and aligned

* Governance-driven incentives that can be directed toward productive markets

* A strategy marketplace that can support different liquidity objectives

### **How It Fits Together**

Pumex is composed of four core pillars:

1. Modular Architecture

    An immutable core with extensible hooks/modules to evolve functionality without fragmenting liquidity.

2. Capital Efficiency

    Concentrated liquidity and automation to maximize liquidity productivity and execution quality.

3. Yield Strategy Hub

    A strategy marketplace where ALMs and governance coordinate liquidity placement and incentive direction.

4. Incentive Engine

    vePMX-aligned emissions and incentive mechanisms that reward the liquidity the market actually needs.

### **Terminology Note**

Pumex uses **vePMX** to refer to its vote-escrow governance mechanism. Any legacy references to similar spellings should be treated as the same concept and considered deprecated.

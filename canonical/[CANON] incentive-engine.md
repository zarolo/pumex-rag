### **Summary**

* The Incentive Engine aligns liquidity, governance, and emissions into a single value loop.

* Rewards are directed toward actors that generate sustained, measurable value.

* vePMX governance controls emissions and fee flows.

* The system reinforces productive liquidity rather than short-term speculation.

---

### **Overview**

The Pumex Incentive Engine is the coordination layer that aligns **liquidity providers, traders, protocols, and governance participants** into a unified incentive system.

It is built on a simple principle:

**Rewards should flow to the actors that create real, sustained value.**

By combining vote-locked PMX (vePMX), smart emissions control, trading fee distribution, and governance-driven incentives, Pumex ensures that:

* capital is deployed efficiently,

* emissions are not wasted,

* and decision-making power rests with long-term participants.

---

### **How the Incentive Engine Works**

At the core of the system are four coordinated participant groups.

---

### **1\. Liquidity Providers (LPs)**

Liquidity providers supply capital to trading pairs on Pumex, either:

* manually through classic or concentrated positions, or

* via ALM-managed strategies.

When LP positions are **staked into gauges**, they become eligible for **oPMX emissions**, subject to vePMX voting outcomes.

LPs receive:

* oPMX emissions (for staked positions that receive votes),

* capital-efficient exposure through concentrated liquidity,

* optional automation via ALM strategies.

LP rewards are therefore tied not only to capital provision, but also to governance alignment.

---

### **2\. Traders**

Traders generate volume by swapping against the liquidity provided by LPs.

Thanks to concentrated liquidity and ALM optimization, traders benefit from:

* low slippage,

* tight spreads,

* and reliable execution.

All trading fees generated by swaps are directed to **vePMX voters**, creating a direct incentive for governance participants to support:

* active markets,

* deep liquidity,

* and efficient trading routes.

---

### **3\. Protocols**

Protocols can participate in the Incentive Engine by competing for liquidity.

By offering incentives or bribes to vePMX voters, protocols can:

* steer emissions toward their pools,

* increase oPMX yields for LPs,

* deepen liquidity depth,

* improve routing quality and aggregator interest,

* and increase ecosystem visibility.

This provides a **permissionless, transparent** mechanism for protocols to bootstrap liquidity without relying on short-term, mercenary capital.

---

### **4\. vePMX Voters**

Users who lock PMX receive **vePMX**, unlocking governance rights and economic participation.

vePMX holders can:

* vote weekly to direct emissions toward specific pools or strategies,

* earn 100% of trading fees from the pools they vote for,

* receive protocol incentives (bribes),

* and shape liquidity flows across the ecosystem.

The longer the lock duration, the greater the vePMX balance and voting influence.

This structure ensures governance power is held by participants with long-term alignment.

---

### **The Incentive Engine in Motion**

The system forms a self-reinforcing loop:

1. LPs deposit capital and stake positions into gauges.

2. Traders generate volume and trading fees.

3. Fees flow to vePMX voters.

4. vePMX votes determine where emissions are directed.

5. Emissions attract more LPs to productive pools.

6. Liquidity deepens, improving execution and increasing volume.

7. Protocols introduce incentives to influence governance.

8. The cycle repeats.

This loop does not rely on speculation or unchecked inflation.

It is driven by usage, alignment, and performance.

---

### **Why the Incentive Engine Matters**

#### **Efficient Emissions**

Emissions flow toward pools that demonstrate real activity and demand, rather than being spread thinly across idle liquidity.

---

#### **Governance-Driven Liquidity**

Market participants — not protocol administrators — determine where liquidity is allocated.

---

#### **Organic Protocol Growth**

Protocols compete transparently for liquidity using governance-aligned incentives rather than opaque deals.

---

#### **Long-Term Alignment**

Participants who commit capital and time through vePMX locks are rewarded with:

* greater influence,

* higher fee capture,

* and sustained incentive access.

---

### **How You Can Participate**

**Liquidity Providers**

Deposit liquidity → stake into a gauge → earn oPMX (subject to votes).

**PMX Holders**

Lock PMX → receive vePMX → participate in governance.

**vePMX Voters**

Vote weekly → earn trading fees and protocol incentives.

**Protocols**

Launch gauge incentives → attract liquidity through governance alignment.

---

### **Closing Note**

The Pumex Incentive Engine transforms incentives from a blunt emissions tool into a **precision mechanism** that rewards performance, commitment, and real usage.

Whether you are trading, providing liquidity, voting, or building, the Incentive Engine ensures your actions directly shape — and benefit from — the health of the ecosystem.

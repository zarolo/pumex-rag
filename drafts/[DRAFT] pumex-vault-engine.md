## **Pumex Vault Engine — Overview (Design Spec v0.1)**

**Truth status: DRAFT**

**Project: Pumex**

**Owner: Core Team**

**Last updated: 17-12-2025 (DD/MM/YYYY)**

**Purpose: Transform emissions and protocol revenue into compounding, chain-aligned value while reducing sell pressure and strengthening long-term governance.**

**Public-safe: NO (internal only)**

---

## **0\) What This Is**

**The Pumex Vault Engine is a yield and compounding layer designed to replace short-term emissions farming with durable, protocol-aligned rewards.**

**Instead of distributing raw PMX emissions that are likely to be sold, the Vault Engine:**

* **absorbs value generated by the protocol,**

* **compounds governance power over time, and**

* **pays users in productive yield assets (INJ or stables).**

**This creates a system where rewards reinforce liquidity, governance, and long-term protocol health.**

---

## **1\) Core Goals**

* **Reduce mercenary behavior: emissions should compound value, not leak it.**

* **Improve capital efficiency: recycle protocol revenue into governance power.**

* **Strengthen PMX economics: reduce net sell pressure over time.**

* **Remain chain-aligned: optionally anchor value around Injective (but not depend on it).**

* **Create reflexive upside: vault-owned vePMX grows → vote yield grows → rewards grow.**

  ---

  ## **2\) Vault Deposits**

**Users deposit vePMX (locked PMX) into the Vault.**

**Design intent:**

* **depositors earn yield, not additional PMX emissions**

* **vault auto-compounds part of revenue into more vePMX**

* **deposited vePMX contributes to aggregate voting power controlled by the vault**

**Depositors retain exposure to:**

* **governance-aligned growth**

* **protocol revenue performance**

  ---

  ## **3\) Vault Revenue Sources**

**Vault revenue is sourced from protocol-native value flows:**

1. **Voting rewards**

   * **trading fees and incentives earned via vePMX voting power**

2. **oPMX redemption flow (partial)**

   * **a configurable portion of oPMX option redemptions routed into the vault**

**These flows ensure the vault is funded by *real protocol usage*, not inflation alone.**

---

## **4\) Dynamic Allocation Logic**

**Vault revenue is split dynamically based on PMX price performance.**

**Exact thresholds and ratios are TBD, but allocation buckets include:**

* **PMX buybacks**

  * **buy PMX → lock to vePMX → deposit back into vault (compound governance)**

* **User yield**

  * **paid primarily in INJ or stablecoins**

  * **avoids direct PMX sell pressure**

* **Treasury allocation**

  * **compounds reserves to strengthen long-term protocol sustainability**

**Design principle:**

**When PMX is weak, compound governance.**  
**When PMX is strong, reward users more aggressively.**

---

## **5\) Epoch Mechanics**

* **vault accounting and distribution runs on a weekly epoch**

* **aligned with existing vePMX / gauge cadence**

  ### **Withdrawals**

* **withdrawals are allowed all week**

* **withdrawals are paused:**

  * **12 hours before epoch end**

  * **12 hours after epoch start**

**This prevents:**

* **reward timing exploits**

* **last-minute voting / withdrawal games**

  ---

  ## **6\) Emissions Management (Key Rationale)**

  ### **Problem**

**Direct emissions create structural sell pressure.**

### **Vault Solution**

* **emissions and protocol revenue are absorbed and recycled**

* **PMX is re-locked instead of sold**

* **users receive yield in non-PMX assets**

* **vault-owned vePMX grows over time**

**Optional user feature:**

* **auto-lock and auto-deposit any earned PMX-derived value back into the vault**

**Net effect:**

**More governance power, less circulating pressure.**

---

## **7\) Baseline vs Injective-Aligned Mode**

### **Baseline Mode (No Injective Participation)**

* **vault functions fully using:**

  * **PMX buybacks**

  * **stablecoin yield payouts**

* **primary focus remains PMX economics and vePMX compounding**

  ### **Injective-Aligned Mode (Optional)**

**If Injective participates:**

* **INJ becomes a primary yield asset**

* **Injective may seed or support an INJ reserve used for payouts**

* **creates symbolic and economic co-ownership**

**Important: the Vault Engine is designed to work without Injective.**

---

## **8\) Performance Measurement**

**Vault performance should be expressed via:**

* **APR (net yield to depositors)**

* **vePMX growth rate (vault-owned)**

* **PMX buyback efficiency**

* **stability of yield across market cycles**

**APR is the primary user-facing metric.**

---

## **9\) Value Loop Summary**

1. **Users deposit vePMX**

2. **Vault votes and earns rewards**

3. **Revenue flows in weekly**

4. **Revenue is split dynamically**

5. **PMX buybacks \+ treasury compound**

6. **Users receive INJ or stables**

7. **Vault vePMX grows → higher future yield → repeat**

   ---

   ## **10\) Remaining Open Parameters (To Finalize)**

* **PMX price signals and thresholds**

* **revenue split ratios under different conditions**

* **percentage of oPMX redemption flow routed to vault**

* **exact payout asset mix (INJ vs stables)**

* **UX framing and naming (Vault, Engine, Dojo, etc.)**

  ---

  ### **Status**

**This spec is now DRAFT v0.1 and suitable for:**

* **internal discussion**

* **economic simulation**

* **partner conversations (under NDA)**

* **narrative design alignment**

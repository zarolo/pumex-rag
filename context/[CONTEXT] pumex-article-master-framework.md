# **\[CONTEXT\] Pumex Article Master Framework**

**Internal content guidelines for the Samurai narrative, ve(3,3) education, and Pumex product explainers**

---

## **1\. Purpose of this document**

This document defines how **Pumex articles** are written so that:

* Every article feels like it comes from the same brain, regardless of author or tool

* The Samurai narrative, ve(3,3) mechanics, and product education stay consistent

* We respect Injective-native readers and wider DeFi users without speaking down to them

This is the **single source of truth** for long-form written content covering:

* Tone and voice

* Narrative framing

* Article structure and layout

* Risk and compliance guardrails

* Category outlines and starter article direction

**Important scope note:**

This document governs *how* we explain things — not *what* the protocol does.

Canonical protocol behaviour, mechanics, parameters, and timelines are defined in the Pumex documentation and always take precedence.

Writers, contributors, and AI tools should use this framework as a **writing authority**, not a source of protocol truth.

---

## **2\. Audience and goals**

### **Who we are writing for**

**Primary audience**

* Injective users who are DeFi-aware

* Wider DeFi participants familiar with DEXs, LPing, and on-chain trading

**Assumptions about the reader**

They already understand:

* What a crypto wallet is

* The difference between a CEX and a DEX

* The basic idea of liquidity provision

They may *not* understand:

* How ve(3,3) actually works in practice

* Why vePMX matters beyond “governance”

* How ALMs differ from manual LPing

* How incentives, gauges, and voting interact

* The Samurai system, crests, or campaign mechanics

* Pumex-specific design philosophy

### **What these articles should achieve**

Articles are designed to:

* Give readers a **clear mental model** of:

  * How Pumex works

  * How ve(3,3) and ALMs affect decision-making

  * How the Samurai narrative translates into behaviour

* Move readers along a path:

  * From *“I don’t really get this”*

  * To *“I understand the design”*

  * To *“I can make a small, informed decision”*

**We educate first.**

Any action should follow clarity — not pressure, hype, or urgency.

---

## **3\. Global writing rules**

### **3.1 Voice and tone**

* We write as **“we”** (Pumex)

* We speak directly to **“you”** when addressing traders or LPs

* The voice is clear, grounded, and native to DeFi culture

**Guidelines**

* Short, clean sentences

* Plain language first, terminology layered in after explanation

* Injective-native phrasing is welcome when used clearly

* Light slang is acceptable; clarity always wins

We respect the reader’s intelligence **and** their time.

---

### **3.2 Narrative spine**

Every article should reinforce at least one of these core Pumex themes:

* **Duty to liquidity**

   Capital is not a toy. Where liquidity sits shapes the health of Injective.

* **Discipline in risk**

   Being active is good. Being reckless is not.

* **Loyalty and long-term thinking**

   Locking, returning, iterating, and learning over time are rewarded.

* **Samurai as a code of behaviour, not a branding gimmick**

   The Samurai narrative is not cosplay or roleplay. It reflects how we think about execution, risk, and responsibility.

Each article should make at least one **explicit, practical link** to these ideas.

---

### **3.3 Standard article structure**

Most articles should follow this structure:

#### **1\. Title**

Clear, descriptive, and honest.

No clickbait.

#### **2\. TL;DR (3–5 bullets)**

* What the article covers

* One or two key takeaways

* What the reader can explore next (optional)

#### **3\. Hook**

* 2–4 lines

* Starts from a real DeFi confusion, pain point, or decision

* Example:

   *“You’ve LP’d before — but what actually changes once ve tokens and gauges enter the picture?”*

#### **4\. Context**

* Where this topic fits within DeFi or Injective

* Why it matters for capital, risk, or execution quality

#### **5\. Core explanation**

* The main body, split into 2–4 sections

* Flow from simple → specific

* Avoid raw maths; use intuition and structure instead

#### **6\. Examples**

* At least one example with **rounded, illustrative numbers**

* Clearly state that examples are illustrative, not promises

* Never imply expected returns

#### **7\. Samurai angle**

* A short section linking the topic back to:

  * Duty to liquidity

  * Discipline in risk

  * Long-term alignment

* Practical, not poetic

#### **8\. Summary**

* 3–5 bullets recapping:

  * What the reader should now understand

  * The mental models to keep

#### **9\. CTA (Call to action)**

CTAs are **soft and educational**, such as:

* Open Pumex and inspect a feature

* Read the next article in the series

* Join the community to ask questions

No forced conversion language.

---

### **3.4 Length and density**

* Target length: **750–1,000 words**

* Use headings and spacing to avoid walls of text

* Mix short punchy lines with deeper explanation

* Lists and bullets only when they increase clarity

Dense with signal — never heavy.

---

### **3.5 Risk and compliance guardrails**

Baseline rules:

* No promises of returns

* No implication of guaranteed yield

* No “risk-free” language

* All examples are illustrative

When discussing strategies, LPing, or incentives:

* Acknowledge risk

* Encourage sensible sizing

* Mention IL and asset risk where relevant

**Optional standard risk note (adaptable):**

Liquidity provision and trading involve risk. Examples in this article are illustrative and not a guarantee of results. Always size positions according to your own risk tolerance.

---

### **3.6 CTAs and funnel design**

CTAs should guide readers logically, not pressure them.

**Within content**

* “If you want to go deeper, read the next article in this series.”

* “LPs should focus here; traders should look here.”

**Toward product**

* “Open Pumex and inspect this pool type.”

* “Start with a very small test position if you decide to act.”

**Toward community**

* “Join the community channels to ask questions or share feedback.”

---

## **4\. Category frameworks (high-level)**

Articles will generally fall into these categories:

* ve(3,3) mechanics & incentives

* Liquidity structure & ALMs

* Execution, routing, and slippage

* Risk discipline & strategy thinking

* Pumex product explainers

* Samurai campaigns & ecosystem alignment

Each category should:

* Educate before persuading

* Use real mechanics, not metaphors alone

* Reinforce Samurai behaviour through action, not slogans

Detailed starter briefs can be layered on top of this framework as needed.

---

## **Final note**

This framework is the **spine** for long-form Pumex content.

Anything generating articles — human or AI — should respect:

* the narrative,

* the structure,

* the tone,

* and the risk discipline outlined here.

If something reads like generic SaaS copy or hype-driven DeFi marketing, it is almost certainly wrong.

**Clarity over noise.**

**Discipline over hype.**

**Proof over promises.**

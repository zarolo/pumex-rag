# **Pumex Samurai Narrative & Content System**

## **1\) Purpose of This Document**

This document defines the **content and narrative system** for Pumex.

Its goal is simple:

Any human or AI should be able to produce Pumex content that feels:

* consistent,

* trader-focused,

* disciplined,

* and grounded in the Samurai frame,

**without becoming cringe or theatrical.**

This system governs:

* how we talk about Pumex publicly,

## **2\) Pumex in One Paragraph**

Pumex is a liquidity and execution platform on Injective for traders and LPs who care about their P\&L.

It is where you go to make liquidity work harder and orders route smarter. Pumex is not a casino, and it is not a meme pit. It is a set of tools built around liquidity, routing, and risk — designed for people who treat trading as a craft.

The Samurai narrative is the lens we use to explain that craft clearly.

## **3\) The Samurai Frame**

The Samurai theme is a **metaphor**, not a costume.

Mapping:

* **Samurai** → serious traders and LPs

* **Battlefield** → Injective markets

* **Blade / armour** → Pumex tools and contracts

* **Clan** → Pumex \+ Injective community

### **What the Narrative** 

### **Is**

* a way to talk about duty, discipline, risk, and execution,

* a cultural wrapper for good trading behavior,

* an identity people opt into: *Pumex Samurai*.

### **What the Narrative** 

### **Is Not**

* anime roleplay,

* random Japanese words glued onto announcements,

* a distraction from real product value.

Tone reference:

*A disciplined trader who appreciates the Samurai lens — not a cartoon character.*

## **4\) Core Samurai Pillars**

These are the behavioural pillars of a Pumex Samurai.

All content should clearly map to at least one.

---

### **4.1 Duty to Liquidity**

Liquidity is oxygen. When it’s weak, everything suffers.

For Pumex, duty to liquidity means:

* caring about depth, spreads, and slippage,

* preferring venues where liquidity is respected, not extracted,

In content:

* explain why liquidity quality matters more than hype,

* call out fragmented or unhealthy liquidity,

* show when Pumex materially improves the trading experience.

---

* no hidden tricks in fees or execution paths.

In content:

* compare execution quality honestly,

* explain how routing decisions are made,

* own issues publicly and explain changes.

---

### **4.3 Discipline in Risk**

Samurai acknowledge risk and plan around it.

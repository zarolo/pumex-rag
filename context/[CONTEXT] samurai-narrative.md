## **Samurai Narrative**

An Operating Code for the Pumex Community

The Samurai narrative in Pumex is not about costumes or aesthetics.

It is a code of behavior — a way of thinking about liquidity, execution, risk, and community.

Pumex uses the Samurai frame to define how traders, liquidity providers, builders, and partners act within the protocol. It provides a shared language and a simple mental model for decision-making, without turning culture into performance.

Every decision — from how capital is deployed to how users interact with one another — maps back to this code.

### **Duty to Liquidity**

For a Samurai, duty comes first.

In Pumex, that duty is to liquidity.

Liquidity is not capital parked in a pool. It is the infrastructure that allows markets to function: enabling entry and exit, supporting new assets, and allowing strategies to scale. Without depth and balance, nothing else works.

Samurai LPs understand that their role is not to chase yield at all costs, but to help keep routes healthy — especially during volatility. They think in terms of depth, longevity, and market function, not just short-term returns.

Duty to liquidity is the anchor that keeps the protocol stable while everything else moves.

### **Honour in Execution**

Samurai take their reputation seriously.

In Pumex, honour shows up in execution:

* how trades are routed,

* how incentives are distributed,

* and how contributors behave.

Execution should be clean, transparent, and explainable.

No hidden mechanics. No confusing fees. No games with data.

When something breaks, it is addressed openly. When parameters change, the reasons are communicated. Traders should trust that if a swap clears, it cleared on fair terms. LPs should trust that rewards follow clear and consistent rules.

Honour in execution builds trust — and trust is what keeps serious capital engaged.

### **Discipline in Risk**

A Samurai does not act recklessly.

Pumex applies the same discipline to risk.

For the protocol, this means:

* structured onboarding of new assets,

* clear pool categories,

* and guardrails around volatile or experimental pairs.

For users, it means understanding sizing, respecting downside, and avoiding impulsive behavior. No revenge trading. No blind leverage. No pretending risk does not exist.

The Samurai frame allows risk to be discussed in simple terms:

train first, prepare carefully, then act with intent.

### **Mastery of Tools**

Samurai were not only fighters — they were students.

In Pumex, mastery of tools means understanding the protocol well enough to use it precisely. That includes routing, liquidity management, analytics, and integrations across Injective.

New users begin as apprentices: learning basic swaps and simple LP positions. Over time, they progress into more advanced roles — using strategy vaults, dashboards, and external tooling to operate with confidence.

The goal is a community that does not press buttons blindly, but understands what the protocol is doing on their behalf.

---

### **Loyalty to the Clan**

Samurai are loyal to their clan and the code they share.

In Pumex, the clan is made up of traders, LPs, builders, and partners who choose to align their activity with the protocol. Loyalty does not mean blind agreement. It means acting in ways that strengthen the ecosystem over time.

That includes:

* sharing useful information,

* reporting issues,

* helping new participants,

* and avoiding behavior that exploits or drains others.

When we talk about “the clan,” we are talking about aligned incentives — users who win when Pumex wins, and who behave accordingly.

### **The Code, Applied**

These five principles —

duty to liquidity, honour in execution, discipline in risk, mastery of tools, and loyalty to the clan — turn the Samurai narrative into an operating code.

They can be used consistently across:

* documentation,

* campaigns,

* badges and ranks,

* and community programs,

without becoming superficial branding.

Everything plugs back into these pillars.

## **3\) How the agent should use this**

Your agent should treat this doc as:

* ✅ source of language, tone, metaphors

* ✅ justification for why Pumex behaves a certain way

* ❌ NOT proof that mechanics *actually enforce* these values

* ❌ NOT evidence of guarantees or promises

**Example:**

* Good use: X post tone, campaign framing, explaining philosophy

* Bad use: “Pumex guarantees fair execution because honour in execution”

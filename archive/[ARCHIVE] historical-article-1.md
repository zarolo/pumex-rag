**INJECTIVE STRATEGY-FIRST METADEX**

Injective is opening a new chapter; Pumex is the liquidity layer built for it. We pair a modern V4 architecture with automated strategies and ve-powered coordination so markets price tighter and incentives stay aligned.

WHY INJECTIVE

Injective’s new EVM gives us Ethereum-grade tooling inside Injective’s finance-native stack. Even better, Injective’s MultiVM design keeps each asset in a single, unified state across EVM and WASM—no wrapped clones, no double accounting.

That’s perfect ground for a MetaDEX: incentives, locks, and programmatic rewards line up cleanly across the stack, and integrations are safer and faster. Add parallel execution, gas-friendly UX, and a hands-on core team, and you’ve got the right home for a DEX focused on capital efficiency and community alignment.

WHAT PUMEX BRINGS

Smart Trade Routing

Every swap is simulated across available paths and executed where you get the best available net output after fees, price impact, and gas. You see the route preview and a min-receive guard before confirming; if a path reverts, we fall back atomically.

Simple goal: reliable, high-quality trades.

V4 Architecture with Hooks

Under the hood, Pumex runs on a modern, hooks-enabled V4 engine. Hooks let us add custom pool logic—dynamic fees, order-type modules, safety rails, strategy logic—without migrating liquidity. Pools can gain new capabilities in place as Injective evolves.

Yield Strategy Hub (ALM-Powered)

LPs pick strategies that match their goals—narrow, wide, stable, correlated, single-sided—operated by advanced liquidity managers. Strategies track price, adjust ranges, and rebalance as markets move, so your liquidity spends more time where trades actually happen.

THE INCENTIVE ENGINE (HOW VALUE FLOWS)

Each weekly epoch, vePUMX voters direct emissions to specific pools. Protocols can boost those pools by adding voting incentives. LPs respond to the signal and allocate where the expected APR is best.

Traders route through deeper books and generate fees. Those fees are distributed to vePUMX voters per gauge policy. Voters then re-allocate, and the loop compounds depth week after week.

Votes → Emissions → Liquidity → Better execution → Volume → Fees (to voters) → Smarter votes

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR INJECTIVE

Deeper books on core pairs. Concentrated liquidity and automation combine to keep more depth near the market price.

Aligned incentives. Emissions follow votes; protocols can steer growth with clean, transparent incentives.

Easier integrations. Unified assets across VMs mean partners plug in faster with fewer edge cases.

Community-directed liquidity. Votes literally steer where rewards go, and programs build loyalty around useful pools.

SAFETY, BY DEFAULT

We build on upstream-audited V4 components. New material changes—gauges, emissions, router adapters, treasury routing—go through independent review before release.

Operations run under multisigs and timelocks. Only vetted, version-pinned strategies go live in production.

WHAT’S NEXT

We’re aligned with Injective’s mainnet timeline and rolling out in stages: swap experience first, then the strategy-first LP flow, followed by additional hooks and partner strategies inside the Hub. We’re also preparing a community kickoff to coordinate early liquidity and participation—more on that soon.

If you’re a trader, expect cleaner prices.

If you’re an LP, expect tools that keep your capital working.

If you’re a protocol, let’s grow depth where it matters.

THE 12 DAYS OF DEXMAS: SAMURAI WINTER

Samurai Winter is our festive growth push on Pumex.

For 12 days, we wanted the timeline full of Pumex traders, LPs, and lurkers showing that our clan stays active while others slow down for the holidays.

If you see yourself as a Samurai on Pumex, this campaign was for you.

WHAT WAS SAMURAI WINTER?

The 12 Days of DEXmas: Samurai Winter ran from 14–25 December on X.

Each day, a DEXmas post was published from @PumexFi. That post included:

The challenge for that day

The link to the one-time registration form (shared on Day 1 and recap posts)

Participants completed the steps on X to earn a chance at daily rewards. Users who maintained a full streak across all days were also eligible for the grand prizes on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.

No questing. No on-chain tasks. Everything lived on X.

WHAT DID PARTICIPANTS HAVE TO DO?

One-time task: quick registration

Participants filled out a short form (around 15 seconds) providing:

Their X handle

Their wallet address

Their Telegram handle

This information was used only to match X accounts to wallets and contact details for prize distribution. The form was completed once and did not need to be repeated.

Daily task: complete the DEXmas post steps

For each daily DEXmas post, participants were required to:

Like the post

Repost it

Complete the day’s challenge in a reply or quote tweet (as specified)

If the registration form was not completed, or the basic post steps were missed, that day did not count toward prizes.

WHAT KIND OF CHALLENGES WERE INCLUDED?

All prompts were designed to be simple, trading-focused, and aligned with the Samurai narrative.

Examples included:

Sharing one trading rule to stick to in the coming year as a Samurai oath

Tagging traders who should join the Pumex Samurai and explaining why

Talking about what users want from a DEX and what makes them stay

Explaining where they mainly trade and what would make them move

Sharing a red flag that makes them step away from a trade

Dropping one lesson learned from a bad trade and how behaviour changed afterward

The goal was to surface real thinking about trading, risk, and tools — not generic engagement farming.

WHAT COULD PARTICIPANTS WIN?

Total prize pool: 500 USD distributed across the 12 days.

There were two reward paths:

Daily prizes

Each day had its own prize pool. Winners were selected from eligible entries for that day. Participants could win daily rewards even if they missed other days.

Grand prizes (24 and 25 December)

Christmas Eve (Day 11):

A special prize chest for Samurai who completed every day up to Day 11, plus additional winners from that day’s entries.

Christmas Day (Day 12):

The Grand Samurai chest for users who completed all 12 days, plus multiple side prizes for that day’s entries.

To be eligible for the top rewards, participants needed a clean streak across all 12 days.

HOW WERE WINNERS SELECTED?

Winners were chosen using a simple and fair process:

Eligibility checks (form completed, required steps done, no obvious bots)

Filtering out spam and low-effort replies

A mix of internal scoring and random selection to ensure fairness

In practice, real users giving real answers had the strongest chance.

HOW DID USERS GET STARTED?

Participants were instructed to:

Complete the quick registration form

Follow @PumexFi on X

Join the Pumex Telegram

Look out for the first “12 Days of DEXmas: Samurai Winter” post on 14 December

Complete the daily steps on each post through 25 December

In short, Samurai Winter was simple:

Show up.

Answer properly.

Hold the line while everyone else went to sleep.

We are Pumex.

You are the Samurai.
